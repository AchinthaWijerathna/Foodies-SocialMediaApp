# FOODIES SOCIAL MEDIA APPLICATION (2023)
This is a social media app we developed as a web application under the Programming Application Framework Module. 
A client comes to our team with the idea of creating a social media platform for "foodies" (reviewers of food and beverages) to share their food and dining experiences.
Food Connect is a dynamic food app developed using Spring
Boot and Angular, inspired by Facebook's social media model. It
brings together food enthusiasts to discover, share, and connect
over their love for food.

Using technologies: Spring Boot, Angular, MongoDB
